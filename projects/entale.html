            <h2 class="work-p">Overview</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Entale (originally named Peeking) is a reimagining of podcasting. The idea started at Founders Factory in the Incubator. I worked on this product for six months in preparation of finding product market fit for it to be then taken on by a founding team.</p>
            <p class="work-p">The idea was to make podcasting more interactive depending on the level of engagement that the listener wanted. Podcasting hasn't changed in years. Entale looked to explore gracefully upgrading from the experience everyone knows to something more engaging.</p>

            <p class="work-p">The original idea was more around giving everyone easy access to creating their own podcasts. Recording on your phone and then immediately uploading to the Podcasting host of choice. However, after doing some customer research, there was not enough interest  in anyone who didn't already have a podcast getting one.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Exploration</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Working with podcasters, we workshopped features on both sides of the listening and creation of podcasts to identify where Entale could make the most impact.</p>

            <p class="work-p">The initial functionality that was arrived upon was chaptered content so listeners could jump in and out and creators could get better analytics on where listeners got to in their podcast.</p>
            <p class="work-p">With chaptered podcast, contextual content could be placed within the chapter so the topic of conversation was enhanced if the listener chose to engage further. From these findings a rapid prototype was created to understand how listeners were engaging with the enhanced features.</p>

            </figure>

            <p class="work-p">The prototype was pushed to a selection of listeners to test with a selection of podcasts. Each had contextual content such as maps or deeper links within their chapters. The hypothesis was that at least 20% of the time a listener would follow a push notification when there was accompanying content. However, the results were 60% of the time a listener would follow to get more context.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Moving forward</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Peeking was then rebranded to be Entale to prepare it to be spun out to a founding team. This redesign also came with added attention to how discovery of podcasts could work. With a chapter based system, how could we attract listeners to bite sized portions of a new show.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Other mediums</h2>
            <p class="work-p">We approached the Guardian with our idea and they loved the idea of the same, chaptered, rich content being used in a web environment.</p>

            <p class="work-p">The other half of the coin is the editor dashboard. Breaking up a podcast and then publishing it as a whole proved to need a dedicated tool to assist with this process.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Credits</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Huge credit needs to go to Philip Caudell who lead the incubation program while I was working at Founders Factory.</p>
