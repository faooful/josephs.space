            <p class="work-p">SLO Repository (SLO Repo) is looking to build out the foundations of the next generation SLO system. SLO Repo is addressing the problems of key existing products in the Google ecosystem, building convergence and an extensible system. By doing this, SLO Repo addresses the key pain points of Google engineers interacting with their SLOs.</p>

            <blockquote>Create a centralized tool to configure, alert, report and analyze SLOs</blockquote>

            <p class="work-p">This initiative was kicked of by a one week sprint with the core stakeholders with daily read outs to the wider team. We explored the north start experience and areas of focus to align a roadmap.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Foundational research</h2>
            <p class="work-p">The team surveyed over 300 people (spanning software engineers, site reliability engineers and key stakeholders) to understand satisfaction across all user journeys related to working with SLOs. Here are the top issues related to the four phases of working with SLOs:</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Understanding the SLO landscape</h2>
            <p class="work-p">The existing landscape is filled with products which directly plays a hand in the fragmentation of the SLO experience at Google. Each product is homegrown and built on legacy software which makes updating them a challenge.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3bda9f4b-472e-4b27-9619-6820d99474a1%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=84df9e3f-cdfe-47db-ae61-d1578c6f3d01&spaceId=3107fef0-c92a-4d4b-b3d2-be1db5f7d53b&width=2560&userId=2cc634a5-89cc-4ddb-8613-34a9c598c0f8&cache=v2">

            <p class="work-p">Below are screenshots from Viceroy, the most popular of the SLO management tools. Viceroy shortcomings primarily come from legacy that has built up from many engineers working to many different SLO mandates over many years.</p>
            <p class="work-p">Two core friction points are traversing the information and filtering to the data to get to what is most relevant as well as the visual style that hasn't kept up with Google's design language.</p>

            <p class="work-p">Based on the satellite products that exist and their cross functionality, the list of functionality to reach parity was created and grouped by the core areas of dealing with SLOs. The team then chose where we felt we could make the most impact for our EAP. This was in an effort to ensure SLO Repo gracefully evolved into the next generation SLO tool.</p>

            <p class="work-p">SLO repo is is a part of a much wider suite of tools (P2020) and because of the nature of dealing with SLOs, there are a lot of touch points to those other suites. Mapping out where SLO repo fit into not only the Monitoring world, but also the P2020 universe helped place journeys that left SLO repo into context.</p>

            <p class="work-p">Within the SLO life cycle, there are a lot of touch points and hand offs within the team. Building up context of what in the system is being measured and why is communicated around a configuration document and acts as a living artifact to communicate tweaks and refinements to the SLOs.</p>

            <p class="work-p">Improving strategic decision making and reporting was the focus for the EAP. The new dashboard needed to better delineate between different a altitudes of information for each of the outlined personas. Tailoring each level of the dashboard was vital to that audience gathering their necessary information.</p>

            <p class="work-p">While iterating on the designs we did continuous testing using interactive prototypes to progressively test how we were representing the data. This also allowed for a bottom up approach for adoption as members of the research sessions would then tell their team.</p>
