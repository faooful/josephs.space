    		<h2 class="work-p">Overview</h2>
            <p class="work-p">SLO stands for Service Level Objective and is a way to measure the performance of a service. These measurements give insights into what areas of the service need to be focused on (reliability or functionality) and provide a window into the customers experience. While working at Google within an internal tooling organization, I was asked to look into improving the landscape of how SLOs were created, interpreted. I worked as a solo designer, working closely with the product owner and the engineering lead to understand the current landscape, create development strategy and refresh the experience.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Challenge</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Investigating this space uncovered that there are a lot of dashboards and satellite products that have been created. Teams would create their own home grown solutions which in turn meant different configurations fidelity of SLO information. These existing solutions have been building up on legacy, in some situations for years, making it difficult for new engineers joining the team and creates toil when reporting on the performance of these SLOs. The desire was to move towards a unified platform and to expand the personas of who could interact with SLOs. Not only do the engineers need to be creating, configuring and monitoring their SLOs, but team leads and directors need to get an overview of how the services they are responsible for are performing.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Outcome</h2>
            <p class="work-p">The team surveyed over 300 engineers and directors across Google at all levels of seniority and responsibility to get a sentiment of how SLOs were being used. This fueled a week long alignment workshop to plot out what features and functionality should be focused on to ease the adoption of a coherent platform. Based on this high level roadmap and mapping out the lifecycle of an SLO we focused on an iterative production cycle. Creating interactive prototypes and working closely with teams of varying levels of service criticality (from Google Cloud to Google Keep) to build out our solution in the open to insure its usefulness for any service size. Along side creating our early access program (EAP) which focused on getting a quick snap shot of service health, the north star was being designed. This showed the next phase which focused on helping directors better consume SLO data.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Credits</h2>
            <p class="work-p">As the lead designer, I was heavily involved with all aspects of the product from research to visual design. However, this work was a collaborative effort with the talent of Diane Faidy, Kevin Miller, Akhilesh Pant and the entire engineering team.</p>
