            <h2 class="work-p">Overview</h2>
            <p class="work-p">Cell Industries was my undergraduate final year project with Jacob Hammond and Joseph Williams.</p>
            <p class="work-p">The goal was to develop a fictional experience which would allow us to integrate and unite several new web technologies, to use 3D and modern UI and UX techniques and best practices, and to experiment with new ways of interacting with the web.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Overview</h2>
            <p class="work-p">The key feature, and the most technically challenging, was the cloning process. By combining Google Elevation API, Google Static Maps API and ThreeJS, we were able to programatically generate and display 3D topographical representations of real-world areas.</p>
            <p class="work-p">We used ThreeJS to display interactive 3D visuals and implemented many best practices including feature detection, progressive enhancement and RWD to ensure an optimal experience on most devices and browsers.</p>

            <h2 class="work-p">Credits</h2>
            <p class="work-p">This was a join effort between James Alexander Lee and Jacob Hammond. This project would not be what it is without them.</p>
